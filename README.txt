This is a college project designed to show how sorting algorithms react to real world data. I do not recomend using it for any sort of serious astronomy.

For ease of compilation the entire project has been included entirely in the asteroid_mission_planner.cpp file. No other files need to be built or linked. We are aware that not splitting our classes into seperate files is bad form and would impact long term maintainence in production code.

Due to file size limits in github the "asteroids_all.csv" file actually only includes the first 100,000 asteroids from our data set. This is good enough for casual testing, but if you want to see how the code performs on a full million item data set please extract the larger file from asteroids_all.7z.
